Real Housewives of Lagos: An Analysis of Twitter's Perception
Introduction
This project aims to analyze the perception of the reality TV show "Real Housewives of Lagos" on Twitter. The analysis includes data gathering, data assessment and cleaning, data preprocessing, sentiment analysis, and data visualization.

Data Gathering
The code uses the Tweepy library in Python to collect over 170,000 tweets related to the Real Housewives of Lagos. The Twitter API is accessed using authentication keys and codes obtained from a Twitter Developer Account. The tweets are collected using the Cursor object, and two separate functions are used to retrieve recent and older tweets. The data is saved in CSV files for further analysis.

Data Assessment and Cleaning
The gathered data is loaded into a DataFrame for assessment and cleaning. The code checks for duplicates, missing values, and unnecessary columns. Missing locations are filled with "No location", and unnecessary columns are dropped.

Data Preprocessing
The code performs preprocessing on the tweets to prepare them for sentiment analysis. It defines functions to extract hashtags and Real Housewives of Lagos cast members from each tweet. The cast names are standardized, and the tweets are cleaned by removing URLs, repeating characters, stop words, punctuation, and emojis. The remaining words are lemmatized for further analysis.

Sentiment Analysis
The code uses the TextBlob library to perform sentiment analysis on the preprocessed tweets. It calculates the polarity score for each tweet, which represents the sentiment. The sentiment is categorized as negative, neutral, or positive based on the polarity score. The sentiment analysis results are added as columns to the DataFrame.

Data Visualization
The code generates a word cloud visualization to depict the most frequently occurring words in the preprocessed tweets. The word cloud provides an overview of the key topics or themes related to the Real Housewives of Lagos on Twitter.

Conclusion
This code provides a framework for analyzing Twitter's perception of the Real Housewives of Lagos reality TV show. By gathering, cleaning, preprocessing, and analyzing the data, it offers insights into the sentiment and popular topics discussed on Twitter. The generated word cloud helps visualize the most common words associated with the show.
